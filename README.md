# BFDIgame 
This is a BFDI game for my son
Game is called BFDI Lab

The game is like toca boca lab. And everything in the room is like it is in toca boca lab. Characters are soft body, means its made out of helium and it will pop if you squish it real hard. 
When you go in the TLC maker it changes your character to BFDI(Again) or Inmate insanity characters.

What do you do in the game:
drag and drop the characters and they fall to the ground where ever you drag them to. They will bounce and can land on their feet or their head. and you can move them by clicking on them. 

Go into the character select and pick your character from BFDI(a) or Inmate Insanity and BFDI.

And there are 6 things that are the same in toca boca lab: centerfuge, ice extinguisher, bunson burner, electricity thingy, Vial with tube to push liquid into it. 

You can turn the characters into little characters
